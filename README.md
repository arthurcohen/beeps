# beeps

An application to manage phone call reminders for a call-center like operation (in small scale)

## Getting Started

This is only the beggining of this app. A lot of work has to be done here.

The goal is to have an app capable to save contacts in an agenda, indicate the next clients to get in touch, following a order based on the date that the operator has provided, edit contacts, automaticly call the clients at one touch, and more.

Stay tuned for updates.
